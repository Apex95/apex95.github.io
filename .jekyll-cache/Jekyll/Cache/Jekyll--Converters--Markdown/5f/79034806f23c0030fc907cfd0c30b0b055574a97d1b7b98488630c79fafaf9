<p>Iâ€™ve started this blog back in 2012, while I was in high-school, with the intention of tracking my progress in the domain of computer science. I always used to believe that if I could explain a concept to others then Iâ€™ve got a pretty good understanding of that concept. During that time, I tried to publish different technical articles that covered subjects which I, personally, considered interesting for me and for others and turn this into a small notebook.</p>

<p>Mostly, youâ€™ll find here programming-related issues and solutions (initially focused around the .NET framework) that I encountered in my journey, short code snippets and PoCs. My intention is to discuss different coding-related topics while also providing a working example in order to successfully grasp the presented idea and be able to actually test it.</p>

<p>The subjects I will cover range from machine learning to security to networking as these are the domains Iâ€™m currently learning as a masterâ€™s student and currently working with as a junior researcher.</p>

<p>I thank you for reading this short bio and hope this website proves useful to you,</p>
