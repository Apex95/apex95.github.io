<p>Hello again,</p>

<p>Unfortunately my summer holiday’s over… <em><strong>NOOOOOooo!!</strong></em></p>

<p>Ahem… so tomorrow I’ll start the 2nd year at the <u>Faculty of Automatic Control &amp; Computer Science</u>. This means going back to the traditional 5 hours of sleep/night and while I’d really like to keep this blog updated with fancy C# tricks and programs I’m afraid I’ll not be able to. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy programming most of the time but…this might be too much.</p>

<p>Truth be told…the number of articles per month may start converging to 0 :( - once again. If somehow I get some spare time and good ideas for new posts I’ll <u>try</u> to publish them here.</p>

<h2 id="virtual-piano-player-in-c">Virtual Piano Player in C#</h2>

<p>Ok, back to the main idea…</p>

<p>You probably heard about <u>virtualpiano.net</u> - if you didn’t it’s an online piano (made in Flash) that allows you to play notes &amp; chords using your keyboard. However it’s pretty difficult to play (especially on laptop) and it doesn’t have many tabs…so I came up with this little app.</p>

<p>It takes guitar tabs, converts them to keys and sends them to the virtual piano;</p>

<p>Advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it supports multiple instances (you can play 2,3,4 pianos simultaneously but it’s difficult to sync them)</li>
  <li>it doesn’t require focus (like others)</li>
  <li>it can output virtual piano sheets</li>
  <li>it supports chords that require both shifted and not-shifted keys</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are 2 songs “translated” to virtual piano (might not work in rss viewers):</p>

<p>Sourcecode is too messy to be revealed at the moment - also not very short and might require explaining.<br />
Show this page some love and I’ll consider making a tutorial…some day…</p>
