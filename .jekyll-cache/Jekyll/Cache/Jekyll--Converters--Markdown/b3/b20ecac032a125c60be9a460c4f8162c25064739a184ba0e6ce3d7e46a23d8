<p>This tutorial aims to show how to make a <strong>C# Form</strong> with <strong>rounded corners</strong>, using a very simple method. Itâ€™s not actually our policy as we wonâ€™t use code hereâ€¦</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Select a background image for the Form(window) - it must have the Formâ€™s size (if the Form is 300x200, the image must be 300x200 too).</p>

<p>In the tutorial, Iâ€™ll use something like this:</p>

<figure class="image">
  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=" data-echo="/imgs/posts/c-simple-form-with-rounded-corners/1.png" alt="The initial background image" />
  <figcaption><p>The initial background image</p>

</figure>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Use a â€˜specificâ€™ color to cover the corners of the image - so it appears with rounded corners - it can be easily done by drawing a rectangle over the original image. This color will be set as transparent, so it will not show up with the window. For this itâ€™s usually used the <strong>Magenta</strong> (R: 255, G: 0, B: 255) color. I recommend using it for the first time.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll get something like this:</p>

<figure class="image">
  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=" data-echo="/imgs/posts/c-simple-form-with-rounded-corners/2.png" alt="Rounding the corners by adding a border" />

<p><strong>3.</strong> Open <strong>Visual Studio</strong> or any <strong>IDE</strong> and create a <strong>Form Project</strong>.<br />
On the right side, in the <strong>Properties Window</strong> look for <strong>BackgroundImage</strong>. option. Click <strong>Import</strong> and choose the image you made before.<br />
Also in the properties, set the <strong>TransparencyKey</strong> to <strong>Magenta</strong> - so it wonâ€™t show the pink border around the Form.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Finally, set <strong>FormBorderStyle</strong> to none in order to hide the original borders/title bar and youâ€™re done.</p>

<p>Now when youâ€™ll open the window it will show the background image with nice, rounded corners:</p>

<figure class="image">
  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=" data-echo="/imgs/posts/c-simple-form-with-rounded-corners/3.png" alt="A Form with Rounded Corners" />
  <figcaption><p>A Form with Rounded Corners</p>

</figure>

<p>Youâ€™ve probably noticed that the form isnâ€™t moving - thatâ€™s because it has no title bar and border. No need to worry about that, you can find <a href="https://www.codingvision.net/interface/c-moving-form-without-title-bar">here</a> a solution.</p>
