            Soâ€¦ Iâ€™ll try to explain here the concept of gradient descent as simple as possible in order to provide some insight of whatâ€™s happening from a mathematical perspective and why the formula works. Iâ€™ll try to keep it short and...

            Iâ€™ve been trying for some time to learn and actually understand how Backpropagation (aka backward propagation of errors) works and how it trains the neural networks. Since I encountered many problems while creating the program, I decided to write this...
