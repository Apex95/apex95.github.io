<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>The <strong>Gaussian Quadrature</strong> is a method used to approximate the value of a given integral by choosing a set of points (<strong>x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>, ‚Ä¶ x<sub>n</sub></strong>) that will maximize the accuracy. Basically the integral can be approximated using coefficients and known values of our function. It‚Äôs a pretty neat method since it doesn‚Äôt require many points and it works for a set of integrals - not only for one.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int_{-1}^{1}f(x)w(x) dx = \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_if(x_i)</script>

<p>On the example above, we have an integral that we want to approximate and on the right side of the equal sign is the <strong>Gaussian Quadrature</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>f(x)</strong> is our function (it‚Äôs not required to know how it looks like), <strong>w(x)</strong> is a <strong>weight function</strong>.</p>

<p>As you noticed we‚Äôll be working within the interval <strong>[-1;1]</strong> - and we‚Äôll consider <strong>w(x) = 1</strong> (Legendre).<br />
<em>- But‚Ä¶what if the integral has a <u>different interval</u>?</em>; use this little trick:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx = \frac{b-a}{2}\int_{-1}^{1}f(\frac{b-a}{2}x + \frac{b+a}{2})dx</script>

<p>Our purpose is to find a set of coefficients (<strong>A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ‚Ä¶ A<sub>n</sub></strong>) and a set of points (<strong>x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ‚Ä¶ x<sub>n</sub></strong>) that will make this quadrature as exact as possible, for a set of integrals.</p>

<p>To keep everything simple we‚Äôll take <strong>n=2</strong> so our equation will look like this:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int_{-1}^{1}f(x)w(x)dx = A_1f(x_1) + A_2f(x_2)</script>

<p>From now on I‚Äôll be working with this example, however it‚Äôs the same method when <strong>n</strong> has a different value.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-find-the-x-values">How to find the ‚Äòx‚Äô values</h2>

<p>In order to calculate the coefficients (<strong>A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub></strong>) we need to know the values of <strong>x<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>x<sub>2</sub></strong>. If these are not given, we will have to calculate them using some theory implying <strong>orthogonal polynomials</strong>.</p>

<p><u>Now here's how you do this:</u></p>

<p>Create a polynomial (usually noted <strong>œÄ</strong>), that has <strong>n=2</strong> roots: <strong>x<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>x<sub>2</sub></strong>.<br />
It will look like this:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\pi = \prod_{i=1}^{n=2}x-x_i \Rightarrow \pi = (x-x_1)(x-x_2)</script>

<p>Here you need to know this little part of theory related to <strong>orthogonal polynomials</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>polynomials <strong>P</strong> and <strong>Q</strong> are orthogonal if their <strong>inner product</strong> is <strong>0</strong> (<strong>&lt;p, q&gt;= 0</strong>)</li>
  <li>a polynomial of degree <strong>n</strong> is orthogonal to any other polynomial of degree lower than <strong>n</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>These properties are required in order to produce a system of equations which will provide us the values for <strong>x<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>x<sub>2</sub></strong>.</p>

<p>We define that <strong>inner product</strong> that I was talking about earlier:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
<P,Q> = \int_{-1}^{1} P(x)Q(x)w(x)dx %]]></script>

<p>where <strong>P</strong> and <strong>Q</strong> are 2 polynomials and <strong>w(x)</strong> is the <strong>weight function</strong>.</p>

<p>Ok enough with the theory, moving back to our example: we had that <strong>œÄ</strong> polynomial.<br />
Now we pick the first <strong>n=2</strong> terms from the <strong>monomial basis</strong> (<strong>1</strong>, <strong>x</strong>, x<sup>2</sup>, x<sup>3</sup>‚Ä¶).</p>

<p>Notice that those 2 ‚Äúpolynomials‚Äù are of degree <strong>0</strong> and <strong>1</strong> - both lower than <strong>n=2</strong>(the degree of our <strong>œÄ</strong> polynomial) =&gt; these are <strong>orthogonal</strong> to <strong>œÄ</strong>. Knowing this we can create the following system of equations:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
<\pi,1> = \int_{-1}^{1} \pi(x)\cdot 1 \cdot 1dx = 0 %]]></script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
<\pi,x> = \int_{-1}^{1} \pi(x)\cdot x \cdot 1dx = 0 %]]></script>

<p>Note that in there I already did the substitution <strong>w(x)=1</strong>.<br />
By solving the integrals‚Ä¶</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{2}{3} + 2x_1x_2 = 0</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">-\frac{2}{3}(x_1 + x_2) = 0</script>

<p>So we get these values:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_1 = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}</script>

<h2 id="finding-the-coefficients">Finding the coefficients</h2>

<p>This is the easy part - if you managed to get here then you‚Äôre almost done.<br />
To find the values of the coefficients, we‚Äôll use the same <strong>Gauss Quadrature</strong>, but this time on these functions:</p>

<p><strong>f<sub>1</sub>(x) = 1<br />
f<sub>2</sub>(x) = x</strong></p>

<p>where <strong>1</strong> and <strong>x</strong> are the monomials we chose before.</p>

<p>If we rewrite the <strong>Gaussian Quadrature</strong> for these 2 functions we get:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int_{-1}^{1} 1 \cdot 1 dx = A_1f_1(x_1) + A_2f_1(x_2) \Rightarrow A_1+A_2 = 2</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int_{-1}^{1} x \cdot 1 dx = A_1f_2(x_1) + A_2f_2(x_2) \Rightarrow A_1x_1+A_2x_2 = 0</script>

<p>(substitued <strong>w(x) = 1</strong>)</p>

<p>So <strong>A<sub>1</sub> = A<sub>2</sub> = 1</strong>, hence the <u>final equation</u>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int_{-1}^{1} f(x)d = f(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}) + f(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3})</script>

<h2 id="precision">Precision</h2>

<p>The degree of precision for this example is <strong>2*n-1 = 3</strong>. This means if the integrand is a polynomial of degree <strong>3</strong> (or lower) the result will be exact. If not, the result will be an approximation.</p>

<p>Note that this also works for non-polynomial functions; if we integrate <strong>cos(x)</strong> from <strong>-1</strong> to <strong>1</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>original</strong> result: <strong>2*sin(1) ~ 1.6829</strong></li>
  <li>result approximated with the <strong>Gaussian Quadrature</strong>: <strong>cos(-sqrt(3)/3) + cos(sqrt(3)/3) = 1.6758</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Not the best result, but will do - usually adding more points helps gaining precision.</p>
