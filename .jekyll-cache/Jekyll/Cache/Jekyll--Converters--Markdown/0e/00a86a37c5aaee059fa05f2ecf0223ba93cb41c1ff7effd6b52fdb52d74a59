I"þ<p><strong>Child Forms</strong> are those forms that are found inside another form (parent form). There are multiple ways to create child forms - most of them require to use a <strong>MDI Container</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="child-forms-without-mdi-container">Child Forms without MDI Container</h2>

<p>I, personally, had lots of problems when I used it (parent formâ€™s controls were going over the child form), so I decided to create child forms without involving a MDI Container. This method will let you solve the problem with the controls that go over child forms, by allowing you to use <strong>BringToFront()</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="how-to">How to:</h2>

<p>The main trick here is to treat <strong>child forms</strong> as <strong>Controls</strong>. Youâ€™ll create a child form just like any other control. When you use this method, you have to set itâ€™s <strong>TopLevel</strong> to <strong>false</strong> - otherwise it wonâ€™t work.</p>

<p>The following lines of code are used to create a child form:</p>
