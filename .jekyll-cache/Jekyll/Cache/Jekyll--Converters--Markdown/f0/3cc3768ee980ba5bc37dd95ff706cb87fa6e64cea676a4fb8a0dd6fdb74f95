            Inspired by the progress of driverless cars and by the fact that this subject is not thoroughly discussed I decided to give it a shot at creating smooth targeted adversarial samples that are interpreted as legit traffic signs with a...

            In this article, I’m going to discuss about my Bachelor’s degree final project, which is about evaluating the robustness of OCR systems (such as Tesseract or Google’s Cloud Vision) when adversarial samples are presented as inputs. It’s somewhere in-between fuzzing...
