        I know I don't publish very often - but you can find out when that happens:<br> 
        <a class="newsletter-link" href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/codingvision" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">
         coding.vision newsletter</a>
    </section>    

    
    <section id = "categories">

    {% for page in site.pages %}
        {% if page.title and page.iscategory %}
        <a class="category-link" href="{{page.url}}" name="{{ page.title }}">{{ page.title }}</a>
        {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
