## About this blog

I've started this blog back in 2012, while I was in high-school, with the intention of tracking my progress in the domain of computer science. I always used to believe that if I could explain a concept to others then I've got a pretty good understanding of that concept. During that time, I tried to publish different technical articles that covered subjects which I, personally, considered interesting for me and for others and turn this into a small notebook.

Mostly, you'll find here programming-related issues and solutions (initially focused around the .NET framework) that I encountered in my journey, short code snippets and PoCs. My intention is to discuss different coding-related topics while also providing a working example in order to successfully grasp the presented idea and be able to actually test it.

The subjects I will cover range from machine learning to security to networking as these are the domains I'm currently learning as a master's student and currently working with as a junior researcher.


I thank you for reading this short bio and hope this website proves useful to you,
